# Language_Translator-using-Machine-Learning
It explores the development of a language translation application using machine learning techniques and the Python programming language. The project incorporates a user-friendly graphical interface built with the Tkinter library and leverages the power of the Google Translate API through the Googletrans library.
You can run the python file in the kernel of python.

Certainly! Here's a README file template for your Python language translator project with speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities using the Googletrans API:

# Python Language Translator with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech

This project is a Python-based language translator that utilizes the Googletrans API for text translation. Additionally, it incorporates speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities to allow users to interact with the translator using spoken language.

## Features

- **Text Translation**: Translate text between multiple languages using the Googletrans API.
- **Speech-to-Text Input**: Convert spoken language input into text for translation.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Convert translated text into spoken language output for user convenience.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detect the language of the input text.
- **Customization**: Easily customize the supported languages and speech recognition settings.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Googletrans API
- SpeechRecognition library
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translator.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1 SpeechRecognition gTTS
   ```
3. **Google API Setup**:
   - Obtain Google API credentials for the Googletrans API and configure them in your environment variables.
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   python translator.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Text Translation**: Enter text in the command line interface for translation.
- **Speech Input**: Speak your text input when prompted for speech-to-text translation.
- **Speech Output**: Hear the translated text as spoken language output.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detect the language of the input text for translation.
